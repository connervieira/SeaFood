# Sea Food

A short arcade game about picking up trash on the beach.


## Description

Hundreds of thousands of marine animals are killed by plastic pollution every year. A significant portion of this pollution comes from single-use plastics like disposable bottles. When bottles aren't disposed of properly, they often get washed into lakes and oceans, which causes extensive damage to aquatic ecosystems.

Sea Food is an arcade style game where the player drives around on a beach, picking up garbage. The more litter collected, the more marine animals that get saved!
